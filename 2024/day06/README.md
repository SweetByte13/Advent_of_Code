# Advent of Code 2024 - Day 6: Guard Gallivant

This repository contains the solution to the **Advent of Code 2024 - Day 6** puzzle: **Guard Gallivant**.

## Problem Description

### Part 1

You have been transported to the North Pole prototype suit manufacturing lab in the year 1518. A single guard is patrolling this part of the lab. You need to predict the guard's patrol route to ensure the historians can search safely.

You start by making a map of the situation, where:
- The guard's current position is marked with `^` (facing up).
- Obstructions like crates, desks, and alchemical reactors are marked as `#`.

The guard follows a strict patrol protocol:
1. If there is something directly in front, turn right 90 degrees.
2. Otherwise, take a step forward.

You need to predict the guard's route and determine how many distinct positions the guard visits before leaving the mapped area.

### Part 2

The historians need to place a new obstruction to trap the guard in a loop, making the rest of the lab safe to search. The obstruction cannot be placed at the guard's starting position. You need to determine how many different positions could be chosen for this obstruction to cause the guard to get stuck in a loop.

## Solution

This solution uses Python to simulate the guard's patrol and determine the number of positions visited and the number of valid positions for placing an obstruction to create a loop.

### Example Data

The example data provided is as follows:
```
....#.....
.........#
..........
..#.......
.......#..
..........
.#..^.....
........#.
#.........
......#...
```

### Implementation Details

1. **Constants for Directions**:
   - `RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT, UP` and `DIRS` dictionary to define movement directions.

2. **Finding the Guard's Starting Position**:
   - `find_start(grid)`: Identifies the guard's initial position.

3. **Simulating the Guard's Patrol**:
   - `simulate(grid, x, y)`: Tracks the guard's movement and visited positions.

4. **Conversion Function**:
   - `string_to_grid(data)`: Converts the string input into a 2D grid format.

5. **Main Execution**:
   - Reads the example data as a string.
   - Converts the data to the grid format.
   - Finds the starting position of the guard.
   - Simulates the guard's patrol to find all visited positions (Part 1).
   - Determines the number of positions where adding an obstruction creates a loop (Part 2).

### Usage

To run the solution, use the following command:
```python
python solution.py
```

Ensure the example data is included directly within the script as shown above.

### Output

The script will output:
```
Part 1: <number of distinct positions visited>
Part 2: <number of valid obstruction positions creating a loop>
```

This README provides a comprehensive overview of the solution, including problem description, implementation details, and usage instruction.
