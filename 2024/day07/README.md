# Advent of Code 2024 - Day 7: Bridge Repair

This repository contains the solution to the **Advent of Code 2024 - Day 7** puzzle: **Bridge Repair**.

## Problem Description

### Part 1

The Historians take you to a familiar rope bridge over a river in the middle of a jungle. The Chief isn't on this side of the bridge, though; maybe he's on the other side?

When you go to cross the bridge, you notice a group of engineers trying to repair it. (Apparently, it breaks pretty frequently.) You won't be able to cross until it's fixed.

You ask how long it'll take; the engineers tell you that it only needs final calibrations, but some young elephants were playing nearby and stole all the operators from their calibration equations! They could finish the calibrations if only someone could determine which test values could possibly be produced by placing any combination of operators into their calibration equations (your puzzle input).

Each line represents a single equation. The test value appears before the colon on each line; it is your job to determine whether the remaining numbers can be combined with operators to produce the test value.

Operators are always evaluated left-to-right, not according to precedence rules. Furthermore, numbers in the equations cannot be rearranged. 

### Part 2

The engineers seem concerned; the total calibration result you gave them is nowhere close to being within safety tolerances. Just then, you spot your mistake: some well-hidden elephants are holding a third type of operator.

The concatenation operator (||) combines the digits from its left and right inputs into a single number. For example, 12 || 345 would become 12345. All operators are still evaluated left-to-right.

## Solution

This solution uses Python to evaluate which equations can be made true by inserting the operators `+`, `*`, and `||` and calculates the total sum of valid test values.

### Example Data

Here is a set of fake data for demonstration purposes:
```
1000: 10 20 5 30
720: 8 9 10
12345: 12 34 5
98: 7 7 7 7
540: 9 6 10
300: 5 10 5 6
4321: 4 3 2 1
1024: 4 4 64
3021: 30 21
150: 15 10
2048: 2 10 2 6 8
9801: 99 99
456789: 45 67 89
777: 7 7 7
404: 4 0 4
6500: 50 2 65 0
8888: 8 8 8 8
2021: 20 21
990: 9 10 11 11
67890: 6 7 8 9 0
987: 9 8 7
2450: 24 50
5000: 50 50 50
1234: 1 23 4
5678: 5 67 8
```

### Implementation Details

1. **Evaluate Function**:
    - Computes the value of an expression based on the provided numbers and operators. It supports addition, multiplication, and concatenation operators.
    
    ```python
    def evaluate(numbers, ops):
        val = numbers[0]
        for num, op in zip(numbers[1:], ops):
            if op == '+':
                val += num
            elif op == '*':
                val *= num
            elif op == '||':
                val = int(str(val) + str(num))
        return val
    ```

2. **Generate Operator Combinations**:
    - Generates all possible combinations of `+`, `*`, and `||` operators for a given number of operator positions using `itertools.product`.

    ```python
    def generate_operator_combinations(length):
        return product(['+', '*', '||'], repeat=length)
    ```

3. **Is Equation Valid**:
    - Checks if any combination of operators can produce the target value when applied to the given numbers.

    ```python
    def is_equation_valid(value, numbers):
        for ops in generate_operator_combinations(len(numbers) - 1):
            if evaluate(numbers, ops) == value:
                return True
        return False
    ```

4. **Total Calibration Result**:
    - Parses the input data string, validates each equation, and sums the valid test values to compute the total calibration result.

    ```python
    def total_calibration_result(data):
        total = 0
        equations = data.strip().split('\n')
        for equation in equations:
            value, numbers = equation.split(': ')
            value = int(value)
            numbers = list(map(int, numbers.split()))
            if is_equation_valid(value, numbers):
                total += value
        return total
    ```

### Usage

To run the solution, simply call the `total_calibration_result(data)` function with the input data as a string. Below is an example with the fake data provided above:

```python
data = """
1000: 10 20 5 30
720: 8 9 10
12345: 12 34 5
98: 7 7 7 7
540: 9 6 10
300: 5 10 5 6
4321: 4 3 2 1
1024: 4 4 64
3021: 30 21
150: 15 10
2048: 2 10 2 6 8
9801: 99 99
456789: 45 67 89
777: 7 7 7
404: 4 0 4
6500: 50 2 65 0
8888: 8 8 8 8
2021: 20 21
990: 9 10 11 11
67890: 6 7 8 9 0
987: 9 8 7
2450: 24 50
5000: 50 50 50
1234: 1 23 4
5678: 5 67 8
"""

result = total_calibration_result(data)
print(f'Total Calibration Result: {result}')
```

### Output

The script will output:
```
Total Calibration Result: <calculated result>
```
