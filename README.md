# Advent of Code Solutions

Welcome to my repository for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) solutions! Advent of Code is an annual programming challenge event that takes place in December, where participants solve small programming puzzles each day. This repository contains my solutions to these puzzles, showcasing my problem-solving skills and coding abilities.

## Structure

The repository is organized by year and day. Each day's folder contains my solution code and a README file explaining my approach to the puzzle.

```

## How to Use

Each day's folder contains:
- `solution.py`: The Python script with my solution to the puzzle.
- `README.md`: A markdown file explaining the approach and logic used to solve the puzzle.

To run the solutions, you can execute the Python scripts using a Python interpreter.

```bash
python 2023/Day01/solution.py
```

## Disclaimer

This repository contains my personal solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles. I have avoided including any puzzle descriptions or input data to respect Advent of Code's terms and guidelines. Please visit the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com) for the full details of each puzzle.
